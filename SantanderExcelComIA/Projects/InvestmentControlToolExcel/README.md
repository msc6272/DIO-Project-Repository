## Modifications to the original implementation

1. The support sheet was simplified to a few cells. Also, the formulas for the "Suggested Percentage" of each type of FII were adapted to the new approach.

2. The names of the Sheets were changed too.

## To be implemented

* I think the idea of the project is very simplistic and it not exactly how a FII works. The approach is different for real estate funds (brick) and credit instuments funds (paper). Also, it is not clear when the investor is expecting dividends. In fact, those funds pay dividends regurlaly and not always have a monthly growth. It seems that they mixed Treasuries with FII. They are different instruments.
