Create js/routes-data.js with a global object named RoutesDB containing:

A property "routes" as an array of route objects with structure:
- origin: string (city name with state, e.g. "São Paulo, SP")
- destination: string (city name with state)
- distanceKm: number (actual distance between cities)

Include 30-40 popular Brazilian routes:
- Capital to capital connections (São Paulo-Rio de Janeiro: 430km, São Paulo-Brasília: 1015km, Rio-Brasília: 1148km, etc)
- Major regional routes (São Paulo-Campinas: 95km, Rio-Niterói: 13km, Belo Horizonte-Ouro Preto: 100km, etc)
- Cover different regions of Brasil

Add these methods to RoutesDB object:

getAllCities: function() {
   // Return unique sorted array of all city names from routes
   // Extract from both origin and destination
   // Remove duplicates and sort alphabetically
}

findDistance: function(origin, destination) {
   // Find route distance between two cities
   // Search in both directions (origin-destination and destination-origin)
   // Normalize imput: trim whitespace and convert to lowercase for comparison
   // Return distance in km if found, null if not found
}

The entire file should define one global variable: RoutesDB
